The question quickly comes up 
Are you who you say you are?

These representations may be truthful of false.  The question in idenentity is how do I know.  This is where two additional conepts of identity come out.  Who says so and do I trust your source.

On the way to credability the trust of the party that vouches for you is a potential issue.  You may have a valid credential but if it is not issued by a trusted party, then the acceptance may be reduced.  In todays world where there are few absolute certainties, the need for a relative level or risk score is a way that this scale of trust is often handeled.

In the Global Digital Trust
Insights Survey 2021 from PWC they make the case that Cybersecurity comes of age.  It is an interesting perspective that CISO's are now required to be more sensative to the business needs and are not just a technial role.  see https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-privacy-forensics/library/global-digital-trust-insights/cyber-strategy.html
