# Trust as it relates to IDentity

The question quickly comes up

Are you **who you say you are?**

These representations may be truthful of false.

The question in identity is **how do I know**?

This is where two additional concepts of identity come out. Who says so and do I
trust your source.

On the way to credibility the trust of the party that vouches for you is a
potential issue. You may have a valid credential but if it is not issued by a
trusted party, then the acceptance may be reduced. In todayâ€™s world where there
are few absolute certainties, the need for a relative level or risk score is a
way that this scale of trust is often handled.

In the Global Digital Trust

Insights Survey 2021 from PWC they make the case that Cybersecurity comes of
age. It is an interesting perspective that CISO's are now required to be more
sensitive to the business needs and are not just a technical role.
