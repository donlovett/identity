# \# identity

This is an area to learn more about identity and the methods approaches and
perspectives that can be incorporated.

## Background

there are a lot of different perspectives on what identity means. Although I
would like to explore the broader definitions and implications of the term my
journey to this place is to understand identity management in the context of the
security authorization for large-scale systems.

In researching more about the idea of identity, you don't get very far without
coming across the concept of privacy. In the book surveillance capitalism, the
author takes us on a journey through a well-intentioned organization initiated
to do good and became somewhat corrupted by power and profit. This is probably
not the first time that's happened but with the unprecedented reach power and
influence that the organizations described in the book have in today's society.
